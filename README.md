Being able to access <u>multiple repositories</u> is next on the agenda. But before that can happen, there are a few **kinks that need to be worked out**:

**1. Embedded images are supported, external images are not.**

If you create a folder `/images` in your source repository's root, you can embed images just as you normally would:

```html
<img src="./images/my-image.png"><img/>
```

But, the way this works, takes not being able to support external images.

It's a really easy problem to fix. It's only a design flaw.

Due to how the HTML is produced from Markdown, it's sort of complicated to fix it in a way that makes sense. It's fixable, but to fix it the only way I know how would just be a bandaid.

**2. Folders not yet supported.**

Only files present in the `/root` of your source repository get rendered, and anything that <u>isn't markdown</u> is also ignored. This doesn't feel like a hard problem to fix either, but, I know it will take a lot of careful thought to get it right, and there's no rush to do it just yet - if it was really necessary, there is a number of ways to provide the ability of grouping files.
